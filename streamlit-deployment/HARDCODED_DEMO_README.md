# Hardcoded Demo Dashboard

## 🎯 Overview

This version uses **hardcoded sentiment analysis results** to display a working dashboard immediately while backend integration is being finalized.

## ✅ What Works Now

1. **File Upload** - Upload your CSV with reviews
2. **Backend Call** - Still calls the HF Spaces API (for testing)
3. **Hardcoded Analysis** - Uses simple keyword-based sentiment detection
4. **Full Dashboard** - All visualizations work with proper column names
5. **No Errors** - No KeyError or missing column issues

## 🔧 How It Works

### Simple Sentiment Detection
```python
if 'great' or 'excellent' or 'love' in review:
    → Positive sentiment
    → Appreciation intent
    → Aspects: ['product quality', 'features']

if 'bad' or 'poor' or 'error' in review:
    → Negative sentiment
    → Complaint intent
    → Aspects: ['customer service', 'performance']

if 'how' or 'help' or '?' in review:
    → Neutral sentiment
    → Question intent
    → Aspects: ['support']
```

### Language Detection
```python
if Hindi characters detected (Unicode 2304-2432):
    → language = 'hi'
else:
    → language = 'en'
```

## 📊 Generated Data Structure

Each review gets these fields:
- `id` - From uploaded data
- `reviews_title` - From uploaded data
- `review` - Original review text
- `date` - From uploaded data
- `user_id` - From uploaded data
- `translated_review` - Copy of original (assumes English)
- **`language`** - 'en' or 'hi' (detected)
- **`sentiment`** - 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'
- **`intent`** - 'appreciation', 'complaint', 'question', 'suggestion', 'neutral'
- `intent_severity` - 'standard'
- `intent_confidence` - 0.85 (fixed)
- **`aspects`** - List of aspects as string
- **`aspect_sentiments`** - Sentiment for each aspect

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### What to Do Now:

1. **Test Locally** (optional):
   ```bash
   cd streamlit-deployment
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**:
   ```bash
   git add app.py
   git commit -m "Add hardcoded demo dashboard"
   git push origin main
   ```
   
3. **Reboot on Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
   - Click "Reboot" on your app
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

## 🎨 What You'll See

### On Home Page:
- ✅ Upload CSV successfully
- ✅ "Processing reviews..." spinner
- ✅ Backend API call (visible in debug section)
- ℹ️ Blue banner: "Currently showing demo results"
- ✅ Quick Stats KPI cards
- ✅ Sample analysis results

### On Analytics Page:
- ✅ Sentiment timeline chart
- ✅ Aspect-sentiment heatmap
- ✅ Intent distribution
- ✅ Language breakdown
- ✅ All filters work (sentiment, intent, language, date range)
- ✅ No KeyError or missing column errors

### On History Page:
- ✅ Save dashboard state
- ✅ Load previous sessions
- ✅ Export data

## 🔄 Future Automation

When backend API format is finalized:

1. **Uncomment the API parsing code** (lines marked with `"""`)
2. **Remove hardcoded section** (lines marked with `===== HARDCODED =====`)
3. **Test with real API response**
4. **Deploy updated version**

### Code Location:
File: `app.py`
Lines: ~790-900 (search for "HARDCODED DASHBOARD RESULTS")

## 📋 What to Tell Users

> "The dashboard is currently in demo mode, showing sentiment analysis based on keyword detection. Full AI-powered analysis will be enabled once backend integration is complete. All features and visualizations are functional."

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Simple Keyword Detection** - Not as accurate as PyABSA
2. **Fixed Aspects** - Doesn't extract custom aspects
3. **No Translation** - Assumes reviews are in English
4. **Mock Confidence** - All confidence scores are 0.85

## ✨ Benefits

1. ✅ **Deploy Now** - Don't wait for backend fixes
2. ✅ **Show Working App** - Demonstrate full dashboard
3. ✅ **No Errors** - All visualizations render correctly
4. ✅ **Easy to Upgrade** - Simple code swap when ready
5. ✅ **Backend Testing** - Still calls API for debugging

## 📞 Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Verify app loads without errors
2. Upload test CSV and check results
3. Share demo with stakeholders
4. Continue backend integration in parallel
5. Swap to real API when ready (just uncomment code)

**Status**: ✅ Ready for immediate deployment
**Mode**: Hardcoded demo with backend API calls for testing
**Timeline**: Can deploy in <5 minutes
