## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Aspect Trends:** Placeholder only, no implementation yet
- **LLM Insights:** Static examples, no AI generation
- **PDF Export:** Not implemented
- **Alerts:** Not implemented
- **Click-to-Drill:** Not implemented
- **Large Datasets:** Performance degrades >10K reviews (needs sampling)

### Potential Issues
- **Aspect Extraction:** Relies on specific format from backend (JSON string or list)
- **Date Parsing:** May fail with non-standard date formats
- **Memory Usage:** Co-occurrence matrix can be large (15√ó15√ólen(df))
- **Browser Compatibility:** Not tested on IE11 or older browsers

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor aspect extraction into single utility module
- [ ] Add unit tests for all component functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for filter logic
- [ ] Add error boundaries for visualization failures
- [ ] Implement proper logging for debugging
